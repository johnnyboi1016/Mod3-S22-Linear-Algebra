    "In this section, we're going to take a step back to learn some of the basics of linear algebra - the math that powers most machine learning models. You may not need to know linear algebra just to call a method in scikit-learn to do some modeling, but this introduction to linear algebra should give you a much better understanding of how your models are working \"under the hood\".\n",

    "\n",
    "## The importance of linear algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to kick this section off by looking at some of the many places that linear algebra is used in machine learning - from deep learning through Natural Language Processing and dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principle Component Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems of linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We then start to dig into the math! We look at the idea of linear simultaneous equations - a set of two or more equations each of which is linear (can be plotted on a graph as a straight line). We then see how such equations can be represented as vectors or matrices to represent such systems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "In a code along, we'll introduce the concepts and concrete representations (in NumPy) of scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors - why they are important and how to create them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector/matrix operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We then start to build up the basic skills required to perform matrix operations such as addition and multiplication.  You will also cover key techniques used by many machine learning models to perform their calculations covering both the Hadamard product and the (more common) dot product. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving systems of linear equations using NumPy\n",

    "## Regression analysis using linear algebra and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Having built up a basic mathematical and computational foundation for linear algebra, you will solve a real data problem - looking at how to use NumPy to solve a linear regression using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method.\n",

    "# Motivation for Linear Algebra in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn about algebra as a foundational step for data science, and later on statistics. Linear algebra is also very important when moving on to machine learning models, where a solid understanding of linear equations plays a major role. This lesson will attempt to present some motivational examples of how and why a solid foundation of linear algebra is valuable for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State the importance of linear algebra in the fields of data science and machine learning \n",
    "- Describe the areas in AI and machine learning where linear algebra might be used for advanced analytics \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While having a deep understanding of linear algebra may not be mandatory, some basic knowledge is undoubtedly extremely helpful in your journey towards becoming a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already know a number of linear algebraic concepts without even knowing it. Examples are: matrix multiplication and dot-products. Later on, you'll learn more complex algebraic concepts like the calculation of matrix determinants, cross-products, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. As a data scientist, it is important to know some of the theories as well as having a practical understanding of these concepts in a real-world setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An analogy \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a simple example where you first learn about a sine function as an infinite polynomial while learning trigonometry. Students usually practice this function by passing different values to this function and getting the expected results and then manage to relate this to triangles and vertices. When learning advanced physics, students get to learn more applications of sine and other similar functions in the area of sound and light. In the domain of Signal Processing for unidimensional data, these functions pop up again to help you solve filtering, time-series related problems. An introduction to numeric computation around sine functions can not alone help you understand its wider application areas. In fact, sine functions are everywhere in the universe from music to light/sound/radio waves, from pendulum oscillations to alternating current.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Â Why Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear relationships between such spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to the example we saw above, it's important that a data scientist understands how data structures are built with vectors and matrices following the geometric intuitions from linear algebra, in addition to the numeric calculations. A data-focused understanding of linear algebra can help machine learning practitioners decide what tools can be applied to a given problem and how to interpret the results of experiments. You'll see that a good understanding of linear algebra is particularly useful in many ML/AI algorithms, especially in deep learning, where a lot of the operations happen under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some of the areas where linear algebra is commonly practiced in the domain of data science and machine learning:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer Vision / Image Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rgb.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are designed to process binary information only (only 0s and 1s). How can an image such as the dog shown here, with multiple attributes like color, be stored in a computer? This is achieved by storing the pixel intensities for red, blue and green colors in a matrix format. Color intensities can be coded into this matrix and can be processed further for analysis and other tasks. Any operation performed on this image would likely use some form of linear algebra with matrices as the back end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning - Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a sub-domain of machine learning, concerned with algorithms that can imitate the functions and structure of a biological brain as a computational algorithm. These are called artificial neural networks (ANNs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms usually store and process data in the form of mathematical entities called tensors. A tensor is often thought of as a generalized matrix. That is, it could be a 1-D matrix (a vector is actually such a tensor), a 2-D matrix (like a data frame), a 3-D matrix (something like a cube of numbers), even a 0-D matrix (a single number), or a higher dimensional structure that is harder to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tensor.png\" width=\"850\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the image above where different input features are being extracted and stored as spatial locations inside a tensor which appears as a cube. A tensor encapsulates the scalar, vector, and the matrix characteristics. For deep learning, creating and processing tensors and operations that are performed on these also require knowledge of linear algebra. Don't worry if you don't fully understand this right now, you'll learn more about tensors later!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another (very popular) area in Machine Learning dealing with text data. The most common techniques employed in NLP include BoW (Bag of Words) representation, Term Document Matrix etc. As shown in the image below, the idea is that words are being encoded as numbers and stored in a matrix format. Here, we just use 3 sentences to illustrate this:\n",

    "This is just a short example, but you can store long documents in (giant) matrices like this. Using these counts in a matrix form can help perform tasks like semantic analysis, language translation, language generation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction techniques, which are heavily used when dealing with big datasets, use matrices to process data in order to reduce its dimensions. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that relies solely on calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues to identify principal components as a set of highly reduced dimensions. The picture below is an example of a three-dimensional data being mapped into two dimensions using matrix manipulations. \n",

In the following lessons, you'll go through an introductory series of lessons and labs that will cover basic ideas of linear algebra: an understanding of vectors and matrices with some basic operations that can be performed on these mathematical entities. We will implement these ideas in Python, in an attempt to give you the foundational knowledge to deal with these algebraic entities and their properties. These skills will be applied in advanced machine learning sections later in the course. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a sub-field of mathematics concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transforms between them. \n",
    "The first step towards developing a good understanding of linear algebra is to get a good sense of *what linear mappings and linear equations* are, *how these relate to vectors and matrices* and *what this has to do with data analysis*. Let's try to develop a basic intuition around these ideas by first understanding what linear equations are. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe a system of linear equations for solving analytical problems \n",
    "- Describe how matrices and vectors can be used to solve linear equations \n",
    "- Solve a system of equations using elimination and substitution \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are linear equations?\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. For example, look at the following equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3x + 2y - z = 0 \\\\\n",
    "2x- 2y + 4z = -2 \\\\\n",
    "-x + 0.5y - z = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a system of three equations in the three variables $x$, $y$, and $z$. A solution to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables in a way that *all the equations are simultaneously satisfied*. A solution to the system above is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = 1 \\\\\n",
    "y = -8/3 \\\\\n",
    "z = -7/3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values make all three equations valid. The word \"system\" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A system of linear equations can always be expressed in a matrix form. Algebraically, both of these express the same thing. Let's work with an example to see how this works: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you go to a market and buy 2 apples and 1 banana. For this, you end up paying 35 pence. If you denote apples by $a$ and bananas by $b$, the relationship between items bought and the price paid can be written down as an equation - let's call it Eq. A: \n",
    "\n",
    "$2a + b = 35$  - (Eq. A)\n",
    "\n",
    "On your next trip to the market, you buy 3 apples and 4 bananas, and the cost is 65 pence. Just like above, this can be written as Eq. B:\n",
    "\n",
    "$3a + 4b = 65$ - (Eq. B)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two equations (known as a simultaneous equations) form a system that can be solved by hand for values of $a$ and $b$ i.e., price of a single apple and banana.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve this system for individual prices using a series of eliminations and substitutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Multiply Eq. A by 4\n",
    "\n",
    "$8a + 4b = 140$ - (Eq. C)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 :** Subtract Eq. B from Eq. C\n",
    "\n",
    "$5a = 75$ which leads to $a = 15$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Substitute the value of $a$ in Eq. A\n",
    "\n",
    "$30 + b = 35$ which leads to $b = 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the price of an apple is 15 pence and the price of the banana is 5 pence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## From equations to vectors and matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as your number of shopping trips increase along with the number of items you buy at each trip, the system of equations will become more complex and solving a system for individual price may become very expensive in terms of time and effort. In these cases, you can use a computer to find the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is a classic linear algebra problem. The numbers 2 and 1 from Eq. A and 3 and 4 from Eq. B are linear coefficients that relate input variables a and b to the known output 15 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using linear algebra, we can write this system of equations as shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ss.png\" width = \"320\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You see that in order for a computational algorithm to solve this (and other similar) problems, we need to first convert the data we have into a set of matrix and vector objects. Machine learning involves building up these objects from the given data, understanding their relationships and how to process them for a particular problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these equations requires knowledge of defining these vectors and matrices in a computational environment and of operations that can be performed on these entities to solve for unknown variables as we saw above. We'll look into how to do this in upcoming lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned how a system of linear (simultaneous) equations can be solved using elimination and substitution, and also, how to covert these problems into matrices and vectors to be processed by computational algorithms. In the next couple of lessons, we'll look at how to describe these entities in Python and NumPy and also how to perform arithmetic operations to solve these types of equations."

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, you learned that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between data entities (variables). Linear regression is an important predictive analytical tool in the data scientist's toolbox. Here, you'll try and develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrix operations. This lesson covers least-squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "[You can find a deeper mathematical and geometric explanation of the topic here](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). In this lesson, we'll try to keep things more data-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "- Indicate how linear algebra is related to regression modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you know that the purpose of the regression process is to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed points, in order to later use that model for predicting new values e.g. predicting sales, based on historical sales figures, predicting house prices based on different features of the house, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a very simple toy example to understand how this works with linear algebra. Say you are collecting data on total number of sales per day for some business. Imagine you've got three data points in the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "(day, total number of sales(in hundreds)) \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot these points on a scatter plot with day (x-axis) vs. sales figures (y-axis), this is what we get:\n",

    "## Fitting a model to data - A quick refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of linear regression would be to fit a mathematical model (a straight line) in the parameter space  that best describes the relationship between day and sales. Simple linear regression attempts to fit a line (in a 2-dimensional space) to describe the relationship between two variables as shown in the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"images/new_regr_line.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, if you were to identify a relationship between the day and total number of sales, the goal would be to seek a function that describes this line and allows us to linearly map input data points (day) or **independent variable** to outcome values (sales) or **dependent variable**.  If you do this, you first assume that there is an underlying relationship that maps âdaysâ uniquely to ânumber of salesâ, that can be written in the function form as an equation of the straight line i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = mx+c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is the intercept of the line and $m$ denotes the slope, as shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/new_regression.png\" width =\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the fitting function based on the above as sales being a **function** of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{sales} = f(\\text{days})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "or, from $y= mx+c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{sales} = \\text{days}*x + \\text{intercept} $$\n",
    ">(where **y** is the number of sales per day and **x** represents the day. **c** (intercept) and **m** (slope) are the regression coefficients we are looking for hoping that these co-efficients will linearly map **day** to the **number of sales**). \n",
    "\n",
    "So using this, we can show our three data points ((1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $c + m*1 = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "> $c + m*2 = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "> $c + m*3 = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that our data points do not lie on a line. The first two points make a perfect linear system. When $x = 1$, $y = 1$; and when $x = 2$, $y = 2$ i.e. we can draw a straight line passing through these points. When x = 3, b = 2, you know the three points do not lie on the same line as first two points, and our model will be an **approximation** i.e. \n",
    "> there will be some error between the straight line and the REAL relationship between these parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior can be simulated by using NumPy's `polyfit()` function (similar to `statsmodels.ols`) to draw a regression line to the data points as shown below. [Here is the documentation for np.polyfit()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import polyfit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit with polyfit function to get c(intercept) and m(slope)\n",
    "# the degree parameter = 1 to models this as a straight line\n",
    "c, m = polyfit(x, y, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot the data points and line calculated from ployfit\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, 'o')\n",

    "The line drawn above using this built-in regression model clearly doesn't touch all the data points. As a result, this is an **approximation** of the function you're trying to find. Now let's see how to achieve the same functionality with matrix algebra instead of the `polyfit()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create matrices and vectors\n",
    "A linear system like the one above can be solved using linear algebra! You only need to deal with a few vectors and matrices to set this up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling linear systems from the previous lessons, you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 \\ \\end{array} } \\right] \\left[ {\\begin{array}{c} c \\ m \\ \\end{array} } \\right] = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \\ \\end{array} } \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The intercept and error terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The column of ones in the first matrix refers to the intercept ($c$) from $mx+c$. If you don't include this constant, then the function is constrained to the origin (0,0), which would strongly limit the types of relationships the model could describe. You want to include an intercept to allow for linear models to intersect with the $y$-axis at values different from 0 (in the image shown earlier, $c$ was 2, because the straight line crossed the $y$-axis at $y$=2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In above , we are hoping that there is some linear combination of the columns of the first matrix that gives us our vector of observed values (the vector with values 1,2,2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we already know that this vector does not fit our model perfectly. That means it is outside the column space of A and we can't solve that equation for the vector $x$ directly. Every line we draw will have some value of **error** $e$ associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal is to choose the vector $x$ for unknown variables to make $e$ as small as possible**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinary least squares \n",
    "\n",
    "A common measure to find and minimize the value of this error is called *Ordinary Least Squares*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This says that our dependent variable, is composed of a linear part and error. The linear part is composed of an intercept and independent variable(s), along with their associated raw score regression weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix terms, the same equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = \\boldsymbol{X} b + e $\n",
    "\n",
    "This says to get y (sales), multiply each $\\boldsymbol{X}$ by the appropriate vector b (unknown parameters, the vector version of $m$ and $c$), then add an error term. We create a matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ , which has an extra column of **1**s in it for the intercept. For each day, the **1** is used to add the intercept in the first row of the column vector $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the error is equal to zero on average and drop it to sketch a proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = \\boldsymbol{X} b$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's solve for $b$, so we need to get rid of $\\boldsymbol{X}$. First we will make X into a nice square, symmetric matrix by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\boldsymbol{X}^T$ :\n",
    "\n",

    "## Regression with multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, you saw how you can draw a line on a 2D space using simple regression. If you perform a similar function with multiple variables, you can have a parameter space that is not 2D. With 3 parameters, i.e. two input and one output feature, the fitting function would not be a line, but would look like a plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/new_LinRegresChart.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have more than one input variable, each data point can be seen as a feature vector $x_i$, composed of $x_1, x_2, \\ldots , x_m$ , where $m$ is the total number of features (columns). For multiple regression, each data point can contain two or more features of the input. To represent all of the input data along with the vector of output values we set up a input matrix *X* and an output vector *y*. \n",
    "\n",
    "you can write this in general terms, as you saw earlier:\n",
    " \n",
    "> $\\boldsymbol{X} \\beta \\approx y$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where *X* are the input feature values, $\\beta$ represents the coefficients and *y* is the output (value to be predicted). In a simple least-squares linear regression model you are looking for a vector $\\beta$ so that the product $X \\beta$ most closely approximates the outcome vector y.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each value of input features $x_i$, we can compute a predicted outcome value as:\n",
    "\n",
    "observed data $\\rightarrow$ $y = b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+ \\ldots + b_px_p+ \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "predicted data $\\rightarrow$ $\\hat y = \\hat b_0+\\hat b_1x_1+\\hat b_2x_2+ \\ldots + \\hat b_px_p $\n",
    "\n",
    "error $\\rightarrow$ $\\epsilon = y - \\hat y $\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before,  the formula to compute the beta vector remains:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\large b= (\\boldsymbol{X}^T\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X}^T y $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see that the general solution involves taking a matrix transpose, the inverse, and dot multiplications on the lines of solving a linear system of equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lab, you'll use a simple dataset and with the above formulation for multivariate regression, you'll try to fit a model to the data and see how well it performs. \n",

    "In this lesson, you had a gentle introduction to how we can use linear algebra to solve regression problems. You saw a toy example in the case of simple linear regression, relating days to number of sales and calculated a function that approximates the linear mapping.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll apply regression analysis using simple matrix manipulations to fit a model to given data, and then predict new values for previously unseen data. You'll follow the approach highlighted in the previous lesson where you used NumPy to build the appropriate matrices and vectors and solve for the $\\beta$ (unknown variables) vector. The beta vector will be used with test data to make new predictions. You'll also evaluate the model fit.\n",
    "In order to make this experiment interesting, you'll use NumPy at every single stage of this experiment, i.e., loading data, creating matrices, performing train-test split, model fitting, and evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, youâll be introduced to computational complexity. You'll learn about this idea in relationship with OLS regression and see how this may not be the most efficient algorithm to calculate the regression parameters when performing regression with large datasets. You'll set the stage for an optimization algorithm called \"Gradient Descent\" which will be covered in detail later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe computational complexity and how it is related to Big O notation \n",
    "- Describe why OLS with matrix algebra would become problematic for large/complex data \n",
    "- Explain how optimizing techniques such as gradient descent can solve complexity issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexities in OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the OLS formula for calculating the beta vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\beta =(\\boldsymbol{X}^T\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X}^T y$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula looks very simple, elegant, and intuitive. It works perfectly fine for the case of simple linear regression due to a limited number of computed dimensions, but with datasets that are very large or **big data** sets, it becomes computationally very expensive as it can potentially involve a huge number of complex mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this formula, we need to find $(\\boldsymbol{X}^T\\boldsymbol{X})$, and invert it as well, which makes it very expensive. Imagine the matrix $X_{(N \\times M+1)}$ has $(M+1)$ columns where $M$ is the number of predictors and $N$ is the number of rows of observations. In machine learning, you will often find datasets with $M >1000$ and $N > 1,000,000$. The $(\\boldsymbol{X}^T\\boldsymbol{X})$ matrix itself takes a while to calculate, then you have to invert an $MÃM$ matrix which adds more to the complexity - making it very expensive. You'll also come across situations where the input matrix grows so large that it cannot fit into your computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big O notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, Big O notation is used to describe how \"fast\" an algorithm grows, by comparing the number of operations within the algorithm. Big O notation helps you see the worst-case scenario for an algorithm. Typically, we are most concerned with the Big O time because we are interested in how slowly a given algorithm will possibly run at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Imagine you need to find a person you only know the name of. What's the most straightforward way of finding this person? Well, you could go through every single name in the phone book until you find your target. This is known as a simple search. If the phone book is not very long, with say, only 10 names, this is a fairly fast process. But what if there are 10,000 names in the phone book?\n",
    "\n",
    "At best, your target's name is at the front of the list and you only need to need to check the first item. At worst, your target's name is at the very end of the phone book and you will need to have searched all 10,000 names. As the \"dataset\" (or the phone book) increases in size, the maximum time it takes to run a simple search also linearly increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation allows you to describe what the worst case is. The worst case is that you will have to search through all elements ($n$) in the phone book. You can describe the run-time as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**$O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the maximum number of operations is equal to the maximum number of elements in our phone book, we say the Big $O$ of a simple search is $O(n)$. **A simple search will never be slower than $O(n)$ time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different algorithms have different run-times. That is, algorithms grow at different rates. The most common Big O run-times, from fastest to slowest, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $O(\\log n)$: aka $\\log$ time\n",
    "* $O(n)$: aka linear time\n",
    "* $O(n^2)$\n",
    "* $O(n^3)$\n",

    "\n",
    "* One use case for vectors and matrices is for representing and solving systems of linear equations\n",
    "* A scalar is a single, real number. A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. A matrix is a 2-dimensional array of numbers \n",
    "* A tensor is a generalized term for an n-dimensional rectangular grid of numbers. A vector is a one-dimensional (first-order tensor), a matrix is a two-dimensional (second-order tensor), etc.\n",
    "* Two matrices can be added together if they have the same shape\n",
    "* Scalars can be added to matrices by adding the scalar (number) to each element\n",
    "* To calculate the dot product for matrix multiplication, the first matrix must have the same number of columns as the number of rows in the second matrix \n",
    "* Operating on NumPy data types is substantially more computationally efficient than performing the same operations on native Python data types\n",
    "* It is possible to use linear algebra in NumPy to solve for a linear regression using the OLS method\n",
